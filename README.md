# Machine Learning Coursera: Neural Networks Learning

In this exercise, you will implement the backpropagation algorithm for neural networks 
and apply it to the task of hand-written digit recognition. Also, you will get to try out 
different learning settings for the neural network to see how the performance of the neural network
varies with the regularization parameter and number of training steps (the *MaxIter* \
option when using *fmincg*).
